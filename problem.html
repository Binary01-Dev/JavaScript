        A list of strings is given and each string will do following tasks:
        x is an integer; enter a new x score.
        "+" - Add the previous two scores together to create a new score. There will always be at least
        two previous scores.
        "D" - Make a new score that is twice as high as the previous one. There will almost certainly
        be a previous score.
        "R" - Remove the previous score from the record by invalidating it. There will almost certainly
        be a previous score.
        Return the total of all the records' scores.
        Input: ops = ["7","-8","9","R","D","10","+","+"]
        Output: -9
        Explanation:
        "7" - Increase the record by 7, making it [7].
        "-8" - Increase the record by -8, making it [7, -8].
        "9" - Increase the record by 9, making it [7, -8, 9].
        "R" - Discard the previous score and replace it with [7, -8].
        "D" - To the record, add 2* -8 = -16, making the record [7, -8, -16].
        "10" - Increase the record by one, making it [7, -8, -16, 10].
        "+" - Make the record [7, -8, -16, 10, -6 ] by adding -16 + 10 = -6.
        "+" - Make the record [7, -8, -16, 10, -6, 4] by adding 10+ -6 = 4.
        7 + -8 + -16 + 10 + -6 + 4 = -9 is the total.
